            <h1>Background of Piano</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Piano is an instrument with 88 keys, 52 of which is white and 36 of it is black.There are two types of pianos and they are both not to be confused with keyboards. The two types include the upright piano, which is smaller and less expensive, and the grand piano, which has better sound and key control. Grand pianos are more professional and definitely preferred if you are playing for a competition or concert. 
            <br> <br> 
            On the other hand, keyboards produce sound electronically. With a keyboard you never have to tune it, and can have a variety of sounds to play with. Then again, they are not preferred for professional purposes. </p>

            <h1>Is Piano Hard to Learn? </h1>
            <br>
            <p>It really depends on the person and how hard you are willing to work. For some people, piano comes more naturally to them then others. That's just talent and coordination. With practice however, coordination can be mastered and even surpass talent. What you put in is what you get out.</p>

            <h1>How Long Does it Take to Master Piano?</h1>
            <br>
            <p>It depends on how much work you put in and what your goal is in piano. If your goal is to play well enough for friends and family that can generally be achieved with daily practice of at least 20 mins within two years or more. Everyone learns differently, and for some sight reading and rhythm is harder to perfect. </p>

            <h1>Why Should I Learn Piano?</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Unique to piano, it has the widest range of tones out of all instruments. It is a rather easy instrument to play, though diffucult to master. Piano can cover a lot of notes and compared to other instuments, is a lot easier to play chords and multiple notes at once. </p>
